# Statistical framework
The data presented in this repository was generated by the segmentation method developed from Helmholtz AI.
In the Jupyter Notebook one can see how the data was analysed and how the figures were generated.

# Workflow
1. Aggregate data: aggregate_all_data.ipynb
2. Run analysis for every study: [GENE_NAME]_analyse_data.ipynb
3. Run analysis overview : analyse_dataset_overall.ipynb

1. **Project folders** [GENE_NAME]: <br>
The analysis included several mouse lines. For every line a folder is given with it's data and one analysis notebook:<br>
